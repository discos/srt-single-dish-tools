Multiple monitor fix and additions.
SDTmonitor is now fully compatible with Windows OSes.
It also can display a dynamic number of feeds and channels and is not limited to 14 channels as it was previously.
The PollingObserver used internally has been replaced with PollingObserverVFS (*Virtual File System* like NFS),
which is our most common use case for polling.
The tests coverage has also been drastically increased.
